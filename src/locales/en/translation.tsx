The default minimum margin requirement for CJC MARKETS is 100%. This means that at any time, if your account funds fall to 100% of the required margin, you will be automatically closed. The closing process is as follows: The maximum undisbursed accumulated net position loss will be closed first, followed by the next largest losing position, and so on, until the required margin requirement is met or exceeded. Depending on the size of the open position and the unrealized gains and losses, all open positions may be closed to meet margin requirements.",
        blowUp: " Will trading break the position?",
        blowUpAns:
            " It may or may not break the position, depending on the account occupancy margin and the net value of the trader's account. CJC MARKETS uses floating spreads instead of fixed spreads. Due to the fluctuation of the spread, the net value will change, the spread will increase, and the net value will decrease. Therefore, when the market is in the data or the announcement of the news, as well as the opening and closing time, it is often accompanied by market conditions with spreads. For customers who lock trading, please reserve sufficient funds in advance. [Remarks] Risks about the lockout of the lockouts When the market is in a non-agricultural and other important data or when the important news is announced, the huge fluctuations and the opening time are often accompanied by the market conditions of spreads. For customers who lock the trading, please Keep enough funds to avoid forced spread when the net value is lower than 100% of the used margin due to the spread. If the market is volatile, the position will not stop at 100%, but maybe lower than 100%. The closing of the stop-loss order for the lock order may be asymmetrical. (Because the spread between the bid price and the selling price increases, the transaction price of the bid price and the selling price varies greatly.) Please be aware. CJC MARKETS is not responsible for any loss of lockouts caused by market factors. CJC MARKETS will not compensate for any lockouts caused by market factors. CJC MARKETS has the right to pursue a portion of the lock-up position that is negative due to market factors.",
        blowUpRisk: " How to avoid the risk of explosions caused by locked warehouses?",
        blowUpRiskAns:
            " In the real foreign exchange market, we can't predict the next price level, nor can we predict the spread at the next moment, so we can't predict the specific time point at which the lockout may break. If you must lock a position, please use the following method: When locking the position, please ensure that your account margin ratio is maintained at a high level to avoid forced closing of your account due to factors such as spreads. After locking the position, if you want to unlock, you will close a single order. Please pay attention to keep a sufficient margin, otherwise it will cause the unlock to be opened. Although you may not be able to open the position because you do not use the deposit, when you close any order, your other reverse order will be lost, you need to use the deposit, when your net worth is lower than this order. When the margin is 100%, the position will be released.",
